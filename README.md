A portfolio website is a digital platform that showcases an individual’s skills, projects, education, and achievements in an organized and visually appealing way. It serves as a personal brand identity on the internet, allowing others—such as employers, teachers, or collaborators—to learn about a person’s background and work.

In this project, the portfolio website is developed using front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) provides the structure of the website, defining elements like headings, images, and sections.

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used for styling and layout, adding color themes, spacing, and visual effects to make the site attractive and responsive.

JavaScript adds interactivity, allowing features like theme toggling, editable content, and dynamic background changes.

The website is fully responsive, ensuring it adjusts smoothly on different devices like laptops, tablets, and smartphones. It includes sections such as About Me, Education, Projects, and Contact Information, which make it easier for visitors to navigate and understand the creator’s profile.

By deploying the website using GitHub Pages, it becomes accessible globally with a unique URL, providing a professional online presence without any hosting cost.
